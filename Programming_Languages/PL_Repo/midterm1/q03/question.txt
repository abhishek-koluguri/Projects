What is normal order? Give a working example to illustrate this in a language of your choice.
Discuss here, but put the code in a separate file with proper extension. Ensure the code works.

Normal order is an evaluation strategy in which first the function is called and then the operators and parameters are evaluated when required.

In the program provided, the statement 'number += 2' is never evaluated if the statement 'if(number % 2 == 0)' is not true.
