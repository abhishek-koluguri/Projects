review: clarify

I don't understand what you mean by "which simply adds variable x's value with 4 and does not return any value" then how do you know the result of that computation? Can
you explain why this is a statement and not an expression (is it?).

We can ignore return values, but that does not make expressions statements, 
it's just that we don't use the result.
