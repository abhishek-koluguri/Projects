This code is not in any specific language; it's a pseudo-code.

values = [1, 2, 3]
factor = 4
values.foreach { e -> print(e * factor) }
factor = 7

Is the lambda expression / closure passed to foreach a pure function?
Explain, giving reason for your observation.

If a function reads or writes, from a file, to console, etc., it is considered to be a side effect. A pure function has no side effects. print is a side effect therefore the above lambda expression / closure is not a pure function.
