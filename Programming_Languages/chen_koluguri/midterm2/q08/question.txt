How does Clojure support infinite sequences?

Answer: Sequences are powerful in clojure, these are immutable. Sequences can be infinite in length and we can work around with them easily in clojure, it allows us to take a part of collection and deal with it.

Infinite sequences are supported by clojure with the help of lazy-seq(). lazy-seq() will provide an option to postpone the evaluation until the demand, and take will demand as many results as we specify.

Example:

(defn fact
    ([]
        (concat [1]) (fact1 2)))
        ([p n]
            (let [prod (* p n)]
            (let [nextValue (+ n 1)]
            (lazy-seq
                (cons prod (fact prod nextValue)))))
        )
    )
)

(println (take 5 (fact)))
