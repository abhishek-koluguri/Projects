What is applicative order? Give a working example to illustrate this in a language of your choice.
Discuss here, but put the code in a separate file with proper extension. Ensure the code works.

Applicative order is an evaluation strategy in which first evaluation of operators and parameters is done 
and then the function call is made.

In the program provided, the 'return a+b' returns the value to the function only after evaluating the expression.
