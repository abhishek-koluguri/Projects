What's the difference between a function value/lambdas and a closure? Give examples of both.

A function value/lambda is just an function with no name (anonymous function)

Example:

{|e| e - 1} // function value

A closure is any function which closes over the variables in the scope where the function is defined.

Example: 

total=0
{|e| total += e} // this is a closure because total has to be bounded or closed over to a variable outside the scope.
