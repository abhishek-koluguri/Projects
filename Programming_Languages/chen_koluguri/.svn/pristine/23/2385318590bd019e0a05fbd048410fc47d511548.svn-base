Homework 4: Due 11:59PM December 04

**There will no reviews for this Homework**

Feel free to give answers collectively, and also if you want to, you can call 
out something specific to yourself different from your pair.

(a) What languages did you use in this course? 

Java, Scala, Ruby, Groovy, Erlang

(b) Which one of those you used for the first time?

Yi: Scala, Groovy, Erlang
Abhi: Scala, Ruby, Groovy, Erlang

(c) What are your impressions about all the languages that you used (compare
and contrast in your view)?

It was interesting to use a lot of different languages because most of the
courses we have taken in the past use the traditional C/C++ or Java.

Java : We had to write a lot of code where as Scala, Ruby, Groovy, Erlang 
were much more fluent and expressive and we had to write much less code
for implementing the same functionality.

Scala : We used Scala in most of our assignments. We felt Scala has good expressiveness, 
fluency which helped us in writing less code to implement a functionality.
We observed that Scala is syntactically influenced by Java.  

Groovy: We observed that Groovy is also syntactically influenced by Java but
semantically influenced by Ruby.
In short, we felt that Scala and Groovy were improved in such a way that they
had better solutions for the problems we faced earlier in Java. We found Scala 
and Groovy to be similar in many ways.(syntax-wise, the way they dealt some of the problems)

Ruby : Ruby is a dynamic language which is highly expressive as well. Even though, we were not 
that familiar with Ruby, it was easy to pick up its syntax because of its expressiveness.  

Erlang: Erlang was completely new to us. In fact, we barely heard its name
before this course started. It took us time to learn, but once we got to know it, 
we were able to feel its powerful features like actor system etc.

(d) What did you learn mostly in this course (I'm interested in hearing
your views, things you realized, things you found interesting, things
you did not like so much about any particular language, etc.)?

In this course, we learned how different languages implement different features. 
This will help us to choose which language to choose for a specific task.
In our observation, the languages we used are similar in terms of what they can do. 
That is, each language is providing almost all the features the other 
languages are providing. But they differ in their style of 
implementation of those features. 

We realized that efforts are being made to extend a language to improve its capabilities.
For instance, Java didn't support functional style in its earlier versions but it was extended 
to support it in the recent versions.

We were intrigued by the concept of languages creating more fluent languages(DSLs).
We liked the intelligence of Haskell to figure what we want.
Example : let list = [1, 4..10] // output: 1, 4, 7, 10

We didn't like that, in Java, we had to code a lot for 
obtaining a functionality where as the same functionality could be obtained 
in more elegant way in languages like Scala, Ruby. 
We didn't like the parenthesis notation for each and every line of code in Clojure. 
It seemed like ceremony.
