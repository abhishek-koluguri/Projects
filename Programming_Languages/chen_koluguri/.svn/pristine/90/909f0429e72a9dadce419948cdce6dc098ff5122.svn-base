Homework 4: Due 11:59PM December 04

**There will no reviews for this Homework**

Feel free to give answers collectively, and also if you want to, you can call 
out something specific to yourself different from your pair.

(a) What languages did you use in this course? 

Scala, Ruby, Groovy, Erlang, Java

(b) Which one of those you used for the first time?

Java, Ruby

(c) What are your impressions about all the languages that you used (compare
and contrast in your view)?

Most of the higher level languages are similar in terms of what they can do (The one that is different is pretty much Erlang). It was also more interesting using a lot of different languages because most of the courses I have taken in the past use the traditional C/C++ or Java.

(d) What did you learn mostly in this course (I'm interested in hearing
your views, things you realized, things you found interesting, things
you did not like so much about any particular language, etc.)?
