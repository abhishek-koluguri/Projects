Homework 3: Due 11:59PM November 20

Pick JavaScript as one example and some other language you actually used in this course in one of the assignments.

Mention the name of that language and discuss the similarities and differences of that language and JavaScript. Give
examples.


The language we used most for the course is Scala and therefore we decided to use Scala as our other language.

JavaScript is a dynamically and weakly typed programming language where as Scala is a statically and strongly typed language.

Scala being statically typed means that type verification is done at compile time. Each variable and return type need to know what type they are at compile time. Scala is a bit free in this aspect due to type inference. Type inference means that the Scala compiler can usually deduce the type of the variable from the initialization given. var number = 1, would be deduced as an integer but if you added 1.0 instead of 1 it would be considered a double. If you added var number = "This is actually a string" it would declare the number a string since it is not an actual number. 

Scala being strongly typed means that during runtime, 

JavaScript is dynamically typed and in normal circumstances does not have a compiler (There are some that compiles JS into Java class files). Without a compiler you cannot do type verification at compile time since you run the code instead of compiling. At the same time, JavaScript is also weakly typed.
