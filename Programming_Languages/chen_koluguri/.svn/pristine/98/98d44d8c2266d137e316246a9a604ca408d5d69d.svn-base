Homework 4: Due 11:59PM December 04

**There will no reviews for this Homework**

Feel free to give answers collectively, and also if you want to, you can call 
out something specific to yourself different from your pair.

(a) What languages did you use in this course? 

Scala, Ruby, Groovy, Erlang, Java

(b) Which one of those you used for the first time?

Yi: Java, Ruby
Abhi: Scala, Ruby, Groovy, Erlang

(c) What are your impressions about all the languages that you used (compare
and contrast in your view)?

Most of the higher level languages are similar in terms of what they can do (The one that is different is pretty much Erlang). It was also more interesting using a lot of different languages because most of the courses I have taken in the past use the traditional C/C++ or Java.

Abhi: I found these languages to be similar in many concepts but the implementation of these concepts were different. More specifically, I found Scala and Groovy to be very similar. 

(d) What did you learn mostly in this course (I'm interested in hearing
your views, things you realized, things you found interesting, things
you did not like so much about any particular language, etc.)?

We have learned how a feature is implemented in different languages in different styles. We have realized that most of the languages try to 
provide all the features but in their own ways. We didn't like that, in Java, we had to code a lot for obtaining a functionality where as the same functionality could be obtained in more elegant way in languages like Scala, Ruby. We were intrigued by the concept of languages creating more fluent languages(DSLs).
