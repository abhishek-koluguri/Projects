review: refactor

Check coverage.
After run, run gradle clean and make sure all files created during test run
are gone.

So many warning when code is compiled - remove them.

LowerCaseConverterTest:
So many commented out dead code, what's going on? We should no by now not to do that.

StringWriter:
See refactoring suggestion in code.

PrintWriterTest:
What's the purpose of this? We should be testing FileWriter not PrintWriter.

Excessive duplication in tests, many test doing the same thing on different
objects, expecting only a slightly different result. Remove those duplications.

FileWriter and StringWriter fail DRY by duplication all that code.

review: move forward.

StringWriter:
Make fields private.
Don't use underscore for parameter names, Java convention mixed case
with no underscore.

Write tests to mix converters.

review: Decouple, check OCP

StringWriterWithLowerCaseConverterTest:
writeAStringAndConvertItToLowercase:
Avoid coupling the StringWriter with the LowerCaseConverter directly.

LowerCaseConverterTest:
Don't need that many tests, keep the tests useful.

StringWriter:
stringWriterWithLowerCaseConverter:
This leads to failure of OCP, if we add a new transformation, we have to
change the StringWriter. Decouple StringWriter from LowerCaseConverter,
reduce the coupling.

review: take small steps, get one thing done before moving to the next.

StringWriterTest:
writeWritesAStringToStringWriter:
Change
assertEquals("Hello", stringWriter.getContent().toString());
to
assertEquals("Hello", stringWriter.getContent());

StringWriter:
No need to import java.lang classes.

ToLowerCaseTest:
change to
LowerCaseConverterTest.

UpperCaseConverter:
Remove, let's get one thing done well before moving to the next.

Now we have StringWriter and LowerCaseConverter. Let's write test to
put them together.

review: Keep an eye on SRP and OCP.

StringWriterTest:

StringWriterClass stringWriterClass;
to
StringWriter stringWriter;

writerWritesAStringToStringWriter:
Noisy.
call write first. Make this a void method. Then check the content
from the StringWriter object.

getStringWriter
to
getContent

convertToLowerCaseConvertsContentsInStringWriterToLowerCase:
This test takes the test class away from its main focus, making it
less cohesive, fails SRP. Move this to another test class.

convertToUpperCaseConvertsContentsInStringWriterToUpperCase: 
We just started with lowercase and ran off to another method without
writing more tests for what we started with.

StringWriterClass:
Fails OCP, we have to change this class to add another transformation.
