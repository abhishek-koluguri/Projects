review: revisit 4

2. good
3. good

4. Don't talk theory, stick to the given problem, to what we know. Don't assume, we know what 
we have on hand. Do we have to make a firm decision based on what we know or is there room for 
some flexibility.

review: rework

1. good

2. Insufficient. Tells us how these relate and may be that will help see why
this is not enough.

3. Why would we want these two drones to relate to Drone1?

4. We can come back to this after fixing the above.
