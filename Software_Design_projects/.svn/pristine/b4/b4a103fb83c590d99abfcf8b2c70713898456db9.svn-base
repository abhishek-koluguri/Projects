review: refactor

WeatherReportTest:
tryToSortByCity: Nothing to try, remove the word try from this.

cityData Don't change the input reference. Keep the separate.
List<WeatherData> result = ...
assertEquals(expected, result);

tryToSortListWithOnlyOneCity:
change
List<WeatherData> city = new ArrayList<>();
city.add(cityData.get(2));
to
List<WeatherData> cityData = Arrays.asList(arizona);

Also, reduce noise.
List<WeatherData> result = ...
assertEquals(expected, result);
instead of al that get calls.

tryToSortByTemperature: We don't need sorting by temperature. Remove this test.

tryToFindColdestCity:
Good, again avoid calls to get, they are noisy.
We want to get the city names for coldest cities, not the entire data.

We started with findColdestCity, stay with it, don't run off to findHottestCity
until we have more tests for findColdestCity.

Write test where there is no coldest city, there is one coldest city, there is
two.

tryToGetWholeWeatherReport:
Let's take a look at this test. The getWeatherReport takes cityData. Now we
don't want that. We want to send a list of cities and get the three pieces of
data out of this funtion.

WeatherData:
No need for so many blank lines before the first fieled.

Avoid use of this.something, it's a noise.

WeatherReport:
Vertically line up the dots.

findColdestCity: use stream, map, min, collect.
