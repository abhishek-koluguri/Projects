something specific to one person.

1. What did you essentially learn in this course about design?

- We have learnt how to approach to design a software. We have learnt how to use test cases as a design tool for creating a good design.

	Design with coding allows us to evolve around the design. We get a better design whenever we evolve and re-factor the design. We also learnt how to make a simple design.
	
	
Wherein, a simple design is design which is easy to evolve, easy to understand, easy to make changes and easy to maintain. Moreover, we also learnt about different design 
patterns. Design patterns have many benefits. It systematically explains and evaluates an important recurring design. it makes easier to reuse successful design.
	

Initially we used to make BUFD(Big Up Front Design), which was misleading because we had to change whole design whenever there is a new requirement. But in this course,
we learnt benefits of designing with coding. We learnt how we can make JID(Just In time Design), how it is helpful in whole development process.
	


2. When asked to design a software application, how would you approach it?

First we would start with requirements and user stories, which can help us to understand what will happen in different cases.
We will find out value of stories from user point of view. Then we will find impact of those stories. 
We will focus only on stories with higher value and higher impact.
Once we have user stories, we would go with UML diagrams, because UML diagrams gives us good platform to work on.
We would create a simple design that meets our most valuable requirements. Then we will check whether the design complies with the design principles. 
Once we have a simple design, we will start with writing unit tests first. Eventually the code will get developed as we write different tests.
During this whole process, we would keep eye on design principles. We will make sure that we are not violating any principle.
It would be good idea to ask someone to review our code. 

create a simple design that comes meets our requirements. Then we will check whether the design complies with the design principles. 
If it doesn't, we will make the necessary changes.

3. What are some of the general guidelines you would follow when designing?

Some of the guidelines that we would follow when designing are: 

- Firstly, we will create a prototype and evolve it.
- For given requirements, we will start with strategic design and will go through the tactical design 
  while implementation using test cases.
- We will make use of the test cases as a designing tool for creating a good design.
- We will use various forms of feedback like feedback from customers, colleagues excreta to improve our design.
- We will not forcibly apply the design patterns but make the patterns emerge from the design 
  by complying to the design principles.
- We will avoid unnecessary complexity except the complexities that emerge from the problem.
- We will make sure the design has high cohesion, low coupling and is extensible.
- We also make sure that the design is complete, sufficient, primitive and efficient.
