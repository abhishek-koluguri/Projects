student_membership (model)
name_of_school
school_website
professor_name	(if the student chooses this option)
professor_email
professor_url	(this will be a response from the professor)
student_edu	(if the student chooses this option)
status	(enumerated? pending, waiting, approved, denied)
deny_reason (Venkat want to leave a text message of why he denied the membership)

First after completing the form, status is changed to 'pending'.

At any time the student can log in and check his status.

If the student chooses professor route:
email sent to professor along with a link, when he clicks on the link- he will be asked to enter his url address.The students status then changes to 'waiting'.
Email sent to admin. letting them know a membership is 'waiting'.

If the student chooses the edu route:
email sent to edu address along with a link, when he clicks on the link- the page will show verification complete. The students status then changes to 'waiting'.
Email sent to admin. letting them know a membership is 'waiting'.

Email to admin letting him know a membership is 'waiting':
he is sent a link to a page containing a list of 'waiting' memberships. This could be a drop down list, or just a list. When he clicks on the user email the details are shown. I believe this is the choice for Venkat. Otherwise he would have to keep up with all the emails. He may want a page containing 'pending' and 'waiting'

Another concern. If the membership has not been verified within a certain number of days, something needs to happen. Perhaps send an email to the student asking for another professor, or let him know he must check his edu account.

Admin will approve or deny the request. If he denies the request, he will leave a text message with the reason. This will be visible to the student when he checks his status.

Once the membership is approved/denied the student is sent an email
