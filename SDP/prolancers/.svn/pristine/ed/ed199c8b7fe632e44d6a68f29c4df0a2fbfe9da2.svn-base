Time: 5:30 p.m

Venkat's recommendations:
1. Do not commit the test or development db.
2. Change the presentation title. Do not use titles that make it seem like the user's name.
3. Have a presentation with no discussions in it.
4. Structure comments like the review from the website. Favored syntax:
"Title of new Comment" on Month Day, Year by User.username.
5. Add functionality to show if user is logged in.
6. Be consistent with format.
7. If title is empty or content is empty, have it such that the user cannot click the submit button
						OR
Have a warning or flash message prompting the user to fill the valid fields.
8. Find way to format date.


Next demo/meeting is Wednesday, 4-13-16.
