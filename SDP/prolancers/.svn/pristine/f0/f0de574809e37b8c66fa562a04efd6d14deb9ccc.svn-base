Addresses Reviewed:
student_memberships/index
- Redirected to sign up if not an admin is nice.
- Why does text say "The current status of your request is malicious_attempt"? Is this for all the users in demo? If not, which user has authorization to this page?

student_memberships/activation
- Redirected to sign up if not an admin is nice.
- Consider this: Once a student membership is activated, the student should be allowed to click a link to the sign up page.

student_memberships/not_auth
- Redirected to sign up if not an admin is nice.
- Issue with text: Is it the email id being used or the user's login information?
- Issue with not_auth: What happens when 
- Consider this: Whenever a user tries to gain access to an unauthorized part of the website, a notification should be sent to the admin. and/or user. The message should give some information of the attacker.

student_memberships/admin
- Redirection to sign up if not an admin is nice.
- Issue with admin: Is the student required to give the name and email of the professor? Is this the only route to getting permission to sign up for Agile Learner?

student_memberships/admin
- Redirected to sign up if not an admin is nice.
- A route for the address already exists. Please remove the second one.

discussions/new
- Why does it have a get and a post action attached to it?
- GET request gives blank page.

discussions/index
- Please remove this route. There is no index action in controller to handle this address.

discussions/show
- GET request gives blank page.

discussions/reply
- Why is this address needed? It only shows 'reply!' text.

discussions/post_reply
- Consider this: I get why post_reply and new are different actions, but isn't there a way to manage a new post and reply under one action without affecting readability?

student_memberships/prof_auth
- This page only shows "hello world.....".


Extra comments:
1. What is the need for two routes to student_memberships/admin? See if we can keep it to one.
2. Is there a timeout for sign in if user is inactive? If not, it would be nice to consider.
3. The sign in page needs an overhaul. User should not be allowed to sign in by clicking on a name.
4. There is no sign up page. Should we not have a sign up page for a demo?
