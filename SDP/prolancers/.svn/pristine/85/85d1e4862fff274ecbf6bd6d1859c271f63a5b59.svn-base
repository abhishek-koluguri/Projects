For the final presentation we should talk about how our project was adding functionality to Professor Venkat's website
agilelearner.com

Topics I think we should cover:

1) Show a presentation page from agilelearner.com

2) Touch upon the fact the website already has sign in functionality.

3) Demonstrate our presentation page

4) Go through different scenarios of discussions(empty discussion, reply to a discussion as a different user)

5) Show off the e-mails being sent the different email accounts

6) Demonstrate a user trying to register for student membership

7) Demonstrate a user trying to view their pending student membership request

8) Demonstrate a user who has been approved/denied for student membership

9) Code Coverage? Questions and comments

1. show a presentation with zero discussions
2. click on start a new discussion, the user is not logged in
3. click on start a new discussion, the user is logged in
4. check if the client side validations are present for new discussion
5. add a new discussion
6. signout
7. show the same presenation with the disucussion added
8. click on reply to discussion, the user is not logged in
9. click on reply to discussion, the user is logegdin
10. check if client side validations are working
11. add a new comment
12. add a fe more and show that they are in the descending order of time of creation

--mailer--

2. mail goes to the author of presenation on replying for a discussion, if he is not replying
3. mail goes to the owner of the presenation on replying to a discussion, if he is not replying
