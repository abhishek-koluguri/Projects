Goals: To add dummy data to seed.rb file

Issues: Currently if rake db:seed is ran all the current presentations switch from presentations/3(or 4)
to presentations/5 (and 6) This is because all presentations are delteed at the begining of the seed file.

What needs to be done is add the data without rewriting the old data and increasing the increments of the object in the tables. 

I was using find_or_create_by(), was not successful. More experimenting needed.
