Bugs:

- redirection to the same page after signing in to a start a new discussion.
- add more discussions and replies to the presentation, the one which are using for demo
- 'New discussion posted to your presentation' email : check the content in it. It has mistakes.
- .edu mailer is sending prof mails to sdp.agilerlearner@gmail instead of the mentioned .edu address. (problem: if @student.prof_email != "")
- coverage and all the tests possible

========
Postponed tasks:

- Student Membership Form with validations --> Abhi (postponed for now)
- Discussions layout like Google groups
- Membership date on /index page and also mention in the approval email
- Time constraints for student_membership request (no more than 7 days)
- the verification process with the signin functionality for prof part (minor addition needed)
- imposing restriction on the user for watching the video --> Abhi or Ravi

=======
To-do:

- Nice views required for: prof_auth.html, not_auth.html, verify.html, create.html, activation.html
