HTML5 and RichWeb:
✓ What was lacking
✓ What does Canvas provide

Creating a Canvas:
✓ canvas element and browsers
✓ canvas and context
  ✓ getContext('2d');

Using a Context:
✓ drawing text 
  ✓textAlign = 'center'
  ✓fillStyle = 'orange'
    ✓ also fillStyle = "rgb(#, #, #);"
  ✓font = '32pt Ariel'
	✓fillText('text', x, y)
✓ transparency 
	✓globalAlpha = '0.5'

Drawing on canvas:
✓ drawing lines 
  ✓moveTo
  ✓lineTo
  ✓strokeStyle = 'red'
  ✓lineWidth = 5
  ✓stroke()
✓beingPath
✓ arc(x, y, r, startAnglePI, endAnglePI, boolAntiClockwise)
  ✓ angles 0, 0.5PI, 1PI, 1.5PI, 2PI
✓drawing more shapes
  ✓ point on a circle 
			x + radius * Math.cos(0.75 * Math.PI)
			y + radius * Math.sin(0.75 * Math.PI)
✓ filling shapes: fillStyle = 'blue', fill()
✓ problem with state of context
✓ save and restore

Events:
✓ mouse events
  ✓ document.onmouseup
  ✓ mouseEvent, mouseEvent.clientX, mouseEvent.clientY
  ✓ document.addEventListener('mouseup', draw);
  ✓ offsetLeft and OffsetTop
✓decoupling function from mouse event
  ✓ preventDefault()
✓ touch events
  ✓touchend, touchmove,...
  ✓ changedTouches[i].clientX, ...

Animation:
✓ let's create a simple game
