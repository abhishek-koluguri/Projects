HW 2. Due 11:59PM July 21st

1. What language are you most familiar with?

	  We are most familiar with Java. Java is one of the early languages we have learnt and 
	  we have been working with it on many projects.
      We have used TDD approach while working with Java, which helped us to write robust code using Java, 
	  and also helped us to gain some good knowledge of Java.

2. From that language point of view, how is JavaScript similar or different?
 
	  Main similarity is both support object oriented programming languages. 
	
	  But both Java and JavaScript are different from each other in many aspects.
	  Java doesn't support asynchronous functionality where as JavaScript does. We can use multi-threading in Java,
	  JavaScript is single-threaded.
	
	  Java uses block-based scoping whereas JavaScript uses non-blocking or functional scoping. 
	  In JavaScript, variable declarations are "hoisted" to the top of the current scope. There is no concept of hoisting in Java.
	  
      Java supports Class-based inheritance whereas JavaScript supports Prototype-based inheritance. 
	  Java does not allow us to add properties dynamically at run time but JavaScript allows to add or remove properties dynamically
	  to individual objects or to the entire set of objects.
	
	  Java is statically typed language whereas JavaScript is dynamically typed language. 

      Java constructors are special functions which can be called at object creation, on the other hand,
      JavaScript constructors are standard functions.

3. What are some of the things that excited you as you learn JavaScript?

    We are excited by the free flowing nature of functions in JavaScript where a function can be applied to any object in 
	the context of that object. Previously, in languages we used, functions were confined to particular classes and 
	the object of that class can only use those functions.
	
	Asynchronous functionality of JavaScript is interesting, which is different from sequence calling of functions and enabled us 
	to call another function while a function is still processing.
    
	Lexical scoping and Closure property are interesting as well which help us to use free independent variables by remembering
    the environment in which they were created.

4. What are some of the things that concerns you with JavaScript?

      JavaScript's Asynchronous functionality was confusing initially but we were able to get grip of that when 
	  we got to implement it in our assignment.
      Prototypal inheritance becomes confusing with complex operations.
      
	  Initially we didn't find TDD approach for JavaScript as easy as that of for Java,
      but once we learnt concept of callback or Asynchronous functionality, things went nice.
	  
	  We find readability of the JavaScript is to be difficult when the number of callback functions increase.
