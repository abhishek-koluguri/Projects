HW 4. Due 11:59PM August 14th
There will be no reviews for this homework.

1. What are some of the things you learned new in this course?

	In this course, we have learnt Asynchronous Functionality of JavaScript and how browser uses this functionality to make the application more interactive.
	
	We learned how web applications use AJAX technique to send and retrieve data from server where JavaScript and the XMLHttpRequest 
	object provide a method for exchanging data	between browser and server to avoid full page reloads. 
	
	We learned how a complicated JavaScript code can be written in a very simplified way in CoffeeScript and TypeScript.
	Using jQuery library helped us lower the amount of code we write and after learning to use AngularJS framework, 
	it was made even easier and more interactive applications where developed.  

	Previously, we never thought of doing Test Driven Development on JavaScript. But in this course, 
	we learned how effective test driven development can be. We have learnt that if we can do TDD effectively on our code, it can 
	tremendously minimize our efforts to debug the application manually. 
	
	The concept of Off-line applications seemed very interesting where we can give an application a basic functionality 
	even when there is no internet connectivity. 
	We learned how Canvas Drawing can be used for attractive animations on web-page. We got ourselves familiarized with various 
	testing tools like Grunt, Karma, Mocha, Chai, nodeunit. We also got familiarized with express framework and Node.js
	
2. What was the most exciting thing you learned?

	The most exciting thing we learned in this course is asynchronous functionality. Previously we used conventional synchronous programming
	methodologies in the languages we knew. When we first got introduced with asynchronous functionality, it was very ambiguous for us.
	But when we got to learn how it works and to implement in our assignments it seemed simple with extraordinary functionality.
	We noticed that asynchronous programming helps us to avoid performance bottlenecks and enhance responsiveness of the application.
	
	Another exciting thing we learned under Asynchronous Functionality is AJAX. AJAX allows us to update the web page without 
	having to reload it. AJAX has made the client-server communication really easy. 
	
3. If you were to pick JavaScript, would you use it for client-side, server-side, neither, or both. Discuss.

	We would use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side. We have been in the thought that JavaScript was more beneficial to use 
	on the client side. But when we started using JavaScript in our assignments and projects, we learned that there was no difference 
	between JavaScript and other server-side used programming languages. JavaScript provided all the functionalities that were provided 
	by other programming languages. We have observed that it is up to us to decide what to use depending up on the functionalities 
	of a language rather than depending on the FUD in the industry.
