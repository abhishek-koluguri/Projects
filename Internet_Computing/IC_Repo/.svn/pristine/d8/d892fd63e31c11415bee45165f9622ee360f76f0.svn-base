review: a few things to fix.

"In JavaScript" noise words, remove, we are talking about JavaScript.

1.
Discuss this term first for variables. Then discuss this for functions and how that may be different in some ways. Write in short paragraphs.

2.
"In JavaScript, the difference between calling a function directly and calling it with call or apply is:" extra reading with no value. Remove words that do not add value to the reader.

Recheck the correctness of the last sentence.

What is the purpose of this context object?

3.
More than very less, if we have them as discrete values instead of in an array.
