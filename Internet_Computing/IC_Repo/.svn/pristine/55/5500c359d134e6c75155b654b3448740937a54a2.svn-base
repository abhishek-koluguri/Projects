HW 4. Due 11:59PM August 14th
There will be no reviews for this homework.

1. What are some of the things you learned new in this course?

	In this course, we have learnt Asynchronous Functionality of JavaScript in which called method does not block the calling method 
	while waiting for a response, but it notifies the calling method when response is ready via events and callbacks.. 
	We learned how browser uses this functionality to make the application more interactive.
	
	We learned how web applications use AJAX technique to send and retrieve data from server where JavaScript and the XMLHttpRequest 
	object provide a method for exchanging data	between browser and server to avoid full page reloads. 
	
	We learned how complicated JavaScript code can be written in a very simplified way in CoffeeScript and TypeScript.
	Using jQuery library helped us lower the amount of code we write and after learning to use AngularJS framework, 
	it was made even easier and more interactive applications where developed.  

	Previously, we never thought of doing Test Driven Development on JavaScript. But in this course, 
	we learned how effective test driven development can be. We have learnt that if we can do TDD effectively on our code, it can 
	tremendously minimize our efforts to debug the application manually. 
	
	We learned how Canvas Drawing can be used for attractive animations on web-page. We got ourselves familiarized with various 
	testing tools like Grunt, Karma, Mocha, Chai, nodeunit. We also got familiarized with express framework and Node.js
	
2. What was the most exciting thing you learned?

	The most exciting thing we learned in this course is asynchronous programming. In traditional techniques, a called method 
	is executed synchronously. The calling method is blocked until the called method is finished.
	Hence it takes a lot of time to load the page. On the other hand, Asynchronous programming helps us to avoid performance bottlenecks and 
	enhance responsiveness of the application.
	In an asynchronous process, the application can continue with other work that doesn't depend on the web resource until the potentially 
	blocking task finishes. 
		The browser exposes the asynchronous functionality to the application logic via events and callbacks. 
		In this way, when we call a function asynchronously, the compiler jumps to the next function or next line in the code, 
		and continues the execution.
	And, once the asynchronous function finishes its job, it returns the desired result to the calling function, 
	and the result is displayed to the user. Some asynchronous functions like setTimeOut and
	setInterval executes a given function after every certain amount of time. We used these functions in Bouncing Ball game, 
	where we worked on HTML Canvas and learned how asynchronous functions
	are useful for graphics design and for making animations.
	
		Another exciting thing we learned under Asynchronous Functionality is AJAX. AJAX allows us to update the web page without 
		having to reload it. AJAX has made the client-server communication really easy. 
	It also allows easy	navigation to users in comparison to way of using back and forward buttons. AJAX is also useful for 
	server-side validation.
	
		

3. If you were to pick JavaScript, would you use it for client-side, server-side, neither, or both. Discuss.

	We would use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side. We have been in thought that JavaScript was more beneficial to use 
	on client side.
	But when we started practising JavaScript in assignments and projects, we learned that there was no difference between JavaScript and
	other programming languages.
