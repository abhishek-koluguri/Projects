review: submit not sending data

Give good directory structure, test in tests, code in javascripts,...

Drop should accept more than one item.
Make drop target a non textarea or non textbox.

When submit is pressed ensure the form data is actually transmitted.

Did not find karma config file to run tests.

review: check submit.

Make the location data non-editable.

Drag drop did not work. Make the drop area a non-textbox.

Submit and look at the report from the test server. Make sure form
includes all the form data.

I did not review JavaScript since there were no tests.

review: A few things to fix

User should be able to click on My Location without entering any field.

Clicking on my location should display location.

Submit should display the proper data (see email for the action to take).
