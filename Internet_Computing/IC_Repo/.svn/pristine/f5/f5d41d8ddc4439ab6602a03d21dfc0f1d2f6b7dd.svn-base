review: A few issues

Only one ball shows up on Chrome and Safari. Firefox does not do anything when clicked on the game.

review: Not enough modularization, ball runs out the bottom

Minimize global variable and functions as much as possible.
Keep functions as part of classes where they should belong.

The ball runs out of the bottom.

review: modularize, please

Don't use backslash for directory separation, use forward slash.

Too many variables in the file scope. See email on this topic to the
mailing list and the previous review.

Keep most variables and functions within respective classes based on the
abstract they stand for.

review: modularize

Put functions in good directory structure. Given good names for files.

Create abstraction for pad and the box to keep complexity under check.
