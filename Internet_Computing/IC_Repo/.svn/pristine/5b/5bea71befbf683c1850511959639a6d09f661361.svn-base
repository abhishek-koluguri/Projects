review: show data sent on the server console

Put your name on the landing page so I know I'm looking at your work and not some other pair's.

What if location can't be obtained?

When button is pressed, stay on the same page, give feedback to the user
that the data was submitted, and print on the server console the data
received.

review: nice to see tests, drive with those.

When the Submit button is pressed, stay on the page... same as previous review.

Nice to see you have some tests. Drive code using these tests.

review: Stay on page. Implement offline feature

When submit is clicked, don't leave the page. Give feedback to the user.
Then print the data received from the page on the server.

Implement offline feature.

Embrace TDD, at least give it a try.

review: restructure

Name the file index.html. Don't create a separate client and server directories.
Remember this is web app, the server serves the html to the client.

Start with html and javascripts folder. We can move things around when we
are ready to implement the server side.

Provide all necessary fields in the html page.
